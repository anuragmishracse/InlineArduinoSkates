# InlineArduinoSkates
I recently bought a new pair inline skates and I have done some modifications using an arduino, HC-SR04, JHD-162A, DHT11,LDR.

Steps :
1. Open the Skate folder.
2. You will find the skate.ino file.
3. Copy the code in your Arduino ide.
4. Make proper connections.
5. Upload the code.
6. Enjoy. Hurray!
